#Vespel

This is a visually-rich music player UI built using SwiftUI, focusing on user experience, smooth scrolling, and aesthetic design. The app includes:

A search bar for filtering songs

A horizontal scroll of trending songs with featured cards

Genre tags to filter music types

A scrollable list of trending tracks with album art, artist info, and favorite (heart) toggle

Fully designed for dark mode

While the project focuses mainly on UI and user interactions, the visual polish and structure make it ideal for demonstrating SwiftUI design principles.
